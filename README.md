# chesspos
Welcome! This project is a site I am building in order to familiarize myself with django framework.

The site is supposed to give users the ability to interact with a virtual chessboard, write notes on some of the 
positions they arrive at, and read other user's comments on them. The site uses the following technologies:

Django for backend
javascript for the chessboard
html and css

Feel free to make suggestions or ask questions about the project.
